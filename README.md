### Andreas Fertig

I'm Andreas Fertig, an experienced trainer, consultant, and regular conference speaker for modern C++.

With [C++ Insights](https://cppinsights.io), I've created an internationally recognized tool that enables users to look behind the scenes of C++ and thus understand constructs even better.

I am available for remote or on-site training. See [andreasfertig.com/courses](https://andreasfertig.com/courses) for more information. Classes can be in English or German.
